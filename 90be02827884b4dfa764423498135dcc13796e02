Theoretically it\u0027s possible to set up the wiki so that that provider is not used but this one is, so I\u0027m not sure what would be the correct behavior here. OTOH if that provider is not used, what is userExists even needed for? The login page would not have any username in that case and signup would not work at all since there would be no non-abstaining provider. So IMO just omitting this method is the best choice.",
