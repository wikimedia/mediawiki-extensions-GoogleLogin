      "message": "currently, I don\u0027t know what happens after that? In the auth url for Google I need to set a redirect url (where google should the user redirect after he\u0027s authenticated and allowed us to read the data). This is currently the Special:UserLogin url. This redirect url has a one-time access_token in the url, which needs to be set to the client in order to be able to access the users data.\n\nHowever, if I allow the application to read the data I get redirected to Special:UserLogin (with the access_token in the url), but unfortunately, AuthManager doesn\u0027t recognize this request as an already initiated authentication request and starts a new one (with the well-known form, where I could click \"login with google\" again).\n\nMaybe it\u0027s just too late and I don\u0027t see what I do false or I really don\u0027t see, what I need to do :/ Maybe someone can give a hint? :)",
