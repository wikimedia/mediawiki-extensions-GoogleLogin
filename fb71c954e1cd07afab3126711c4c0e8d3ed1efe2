      "message": "currently, I don\u0027t know what happens after that? In the auth url for Google I need to set a redirect url (where google should the user redirect after he\u0027s authenticated and allowed us to read the data). This is currently the Special:UserLogin url. This redirect url has a one-time access_token in the url, which needs to be set to the client in order to be able to access the users data.\n\nHowever, if I allow the application to read the data I get redirected to Special:UserLogin (with the access_token in the url), but unfortunately, AuthManager doesn\u0027t recognize this request as an already initiated authentication request and starts a new one (with the well-known form, where I could click \"login with google\" again).\n\nMaybe it\u0027s just too late and I don\u0027t see what I do false or I really don\u0027t see, what I need to do :/ Maybe someone can give a hint? :)",

      "message": "Use $req-\u003ereturnToUrl (keep the query parameters it has and have Google add anything you need back from it). Instead of $req use something that can take an access_token (don\u0027t try to access the request directly; rememeber that this might happen through the API in which case $req-\u003ereturnToUrl will point to some third party site, or some URL capturable by a mobile app, in which case it\u0027s their responsibility to construct the AuthenticationRequest). See https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/251930/23/auth/OAuthPrimaryAuthenticationProvider.php for an example. (I wonder if a request type for an OAuth response is ubiquitous enough to be included in core.)",

You should at least allow unlinking google accounts by returning one request for each linked account on ACTION_REMOVE, and then handling those requests here.
