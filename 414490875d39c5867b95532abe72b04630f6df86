(E.g. if I have a separate work and fun browser with different google accounts logged in, I could only log in in one of those.) If not, you should enumerate all linked accounts here.",

Returning a fatal is better, it\u0027s unlikely that anything else would handle a GoogleAuthenticationRequest and the error message the user gets when everything ignores the request is less helpful than an \"account not linked\" error.\n\n(There should be no way for the user to trigger this if you don\u0027t return any requests on ACTION_REMOVE for unlinked accounts, but still.)",
