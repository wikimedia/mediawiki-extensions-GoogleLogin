      "message": "When I don\u0027t have an account linked already, this will add a link to Special:GoogleLogin with the text \"Link Google to wiki account\". Clicking on that redirects me to Google, then would come back and make me click on another \"Link Google to wiki account\" that takes me to Special:LinkAccounts where I have to click on still another \"Link Google to wiki account\" button before it\u0027ll actually do the linking.\n\nWhen I do have an account linked, it adds a link to Special:GoogleLogin with the text \"Account information\". But clicking that redirects me to Google where I have to actually log in again, and when it comes back it might not be showing me information about the Google account(s) that are actually linked with my current account.\n\nNeither of these seem like very good flows. It would probably be better to just kill Special:GoogleLogin and this hook completely, and have general links to Special:LinkAccounts and Special:UnlinkAccount on Special:Preferences instead (I just filed T136710 for that).",
